I wrote this for my Mum to help her make an _informed_ choice about how to live during Covid.

I showed my working in language she could understand, offered necessary context, and let her reach her own conclusions. I wish there was more of that in the world.

Covid affected my family in different ways at different times. ‘_Different_’ contains multitudes and a body bag.

[From December 2019](emailWarning) until late 2021 I was desperate to understand how to avoid an unacceptable outcome for my family. I structured my entire life around that task.

Covid initially looked unacceptably bad, universally. It eventually looked unacceptably bad for some, negotiably bad for others, and a footnote for most.

Those developments were supremely not obvious.

Covid information was and is a cesspit of lies: noble lies, lies of incompetence, lies of arse-covering, and lies for fun and profit.

By late 2020 my Mum had adopted the certainty and models of one team of liars. Her actions began to reflect those wonky models.

_Adult_ decisions about how to live require an understanding of risk.

The lies made it unforgivably difficult to get one, and doubly difficult to undo the damage from believing bad risk models.

If an unknowable amount of information is suspect then, practically, it all is. _If that information is necessary_ then every foundational fact demands critical analysis. Every assumption tyre needs kicking.

That takes a long time.

…

A trustworthy summary of a 20-page study takes moments to read.

Reading the study _critically_ takes, for me, about 3 hours. To repeat for the underlying studies they reference to justify critical assumptions takes another few days. To decide how much weight to give the results once you grok the flaws takes another couple.

To summarise for an audience that a) will (rationally!) dismiss information because of the source, b) has _negative_ knowledge of the relevant topics, and c) is too exhausted and grief-stricken for complexity… takes a little longer.

Nonetheless, this is what I tried to do.

Specifically I worked towards a rigorous and practical answer to the question “_Should we get a Covid vaccine?_”, i.e:

-   Is Covid dangerous to us? _If so_…
-   Can we avoid catching it? _If not_…
-   Can we minimize the danger? _If so_…
-   What options are realistically available to us? _For each_…
-   Is this effective at minimizing the danger? _If so_…
-   At what cost? _and_…
-   What is unknowable and how should we account for that?

Every one of those questions depends on tens of questionettes crossing a bunch of different fields. Every answerette was built upon the shaky foundations of hundred of publications of variably-useful data gathered and published by tens of variably-suspect and variably-competent individuals and organisations.

Getting to the starting line took me ~95,000 words of notes, highlights, and first-pass summaries.

To then write the three essays here took me another 6 months: finding a narrative thread, double-checking my working, building out data models and estimating my trust in the underlying data, and a long slog of trying to simplify without misleading.

My goal was to protect and educate those I love.

I failed as hard as a man could fail. My work changed nothing but my hair colour.

And I only answered one of the 7 questions: pathetic.

Nonetheless, I’m proud of it; I’m proud to say I did a hard, pointless thing unjustifiably wellXFOOTNOTE.

So: [What does Covid do?](symptoms).
