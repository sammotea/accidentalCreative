Friends have described Covid as the sickest they’ve ever felt. I writhed in pain for two nights. My partner rasped for air for a fortnight and is still struggling months later.

Those outcomes were fine. I fear hospital stays, disabilities, and body bags.

I don’t know your risk of those _today_. I can make a guesstimate of what those risks were _recently_: a reasonable baseline for discussions about current and future developments.

That guesstimate comes from wrangling sources of varying quality to answer the following questions:

-   How many people in England had Covid in January 2021XFOOTNOTE; and
-   What happened to those people while they were riddled with virus; and
-   What characteristics of those people seem to have affected their outcome.

## How many people had Covid in January 2021?

About two million, I think.

[Officially there were one million cases](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases?areaType=nation&areaName=England). These counts only include cases where someone _chose_ and _was able_ to take a test that came back positiveXFOOTNOTE.

Two nationwide surveys suggest the official tally missed half a million casesXFOOTNOTE. Those surveys are in turn limited by their reliance on the type of person who _volunteers_ to be actively observed. I assume that person made more effort than normals to avoid the virus.

I don't know the real number but I'm confident the proxies above undercount cases.

My fudge is to round up to two million.

## What happened to those people?

-   [100k](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/uec-sitrep/urgent-and-emergency-care-daily-situation-reports-2020-21/) were hospitalizedXFOOTNOTEXFOOTNOTE.
-   [30k](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths?areaType=nation&areaName=England) diedXFOOTNOTE.

_On average_ they had **20:1** odds of hospitalisation and **65:1** odds of death.

Averages can get in the bin. Individual outcomes depended on age and health.

### Outcomes by age

Covid barely touched the young:[ 1,200 were hospitalised](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wjucMoNfyz8ZnpGzA6RyaCm4fBnUb89d666k77uEWuc/) and [9 died](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wjucMoNfyz8ZnpGzA6RyaCm4fBnUb89d666k77uEWuc/).

It was a catastrophe for older folk: [60,000 were hospitalised](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wjucMoNfyz8ZnpGzA6RyaCm4fBnUb89d666k77uEWuc/) and [25,000 died](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9dwVXfqBXUps0f69g5dn3XN2CeDEObHidk0cAaVo8s/).

It _mostly_ affected the old. It didn’t _only_ affect the old. Roughly [3% of working-age folk who caught Covid in January were hospitalised](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wjucMoNfyz8ZnpGzA6RyaCm4fBnUb89d666k77uEWuc/).

_From my case estimates_ [hospitalisation risks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wjucMoNfyz8ZnpGzA6RyaCm4fBnUb89d666k77uEWuc/) looked like:

[Death risks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9dwVXfqBXUps0f69g5dn3XN2CeDEObHidk0cAaVo8s/) looked like:

### Outcomes by health status

The unhealthy were at higher risk. The pre-existing health problems that mattered most are common as muck.

[50% of hospital cases had high blood pressure](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n693#T1) before they caught Covid. [65% of deaths](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XqkvCoyQDNHQtm7Ez7bdpcDxAm0WMWttfcWGXA6SyM8/edit#gid=0) had some combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and / or heart disease alreadyXFOOTNOTE, and 20% had lung problems before they became ill.

It _mostly_ affected the unhealthy. It didn’t _only_ affect the unhealthy. [20% of those in hospital](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1985#T1) and [15% of those who died](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XqkvCoyQDNHQtm7Ez7bdpcDxAm0WMWttfcWGXA6SyM8/edit#gid=0) were fit and well before they caught Covid.

## What does that mean for you?

Someone like you—a healthy 60-something—had ~**40:1** oddsXFOOTNOTE of hospitalisation from Covid. Those odds scare me.

Covid can make you really, _unacceptably_ ill.

Or worse. A small-but-way-too-high number of people deteriorated in hospital and ended up in ICUXFOOTNOTE. It was then a coin-flip whether they left alive.

Covid is the only _avoidable_ threat in my lifetime that can _realistically_ kill you, or dad, or your friends.

And there are additional long-term risks. Next up, [Long Covid](longCovid).
