I wrote this for my Mum to help her make an _informed_ choice about how to live during Covid.

I showed my working, provided context, and let her reach her own conclusions. There wasn’t much of that available at the time.

Information about Covid was mostly black and white and wrong.

Black _or_ white, rather:

-   “_Covid is deadly / just the flu!_”
-   “_Vaccines will save you / kill you!_”
-   “_Masks save lives / do nothing!_”

By late 2020 my Mum had adopted the certainty and models of one team. Her actions began to reflect those wonky models.

I tried to give her the means to make her own model.

Specifically I tried to exhaustively answer the question “_Should we get a Covid vaccine?_” which mapped to:

-   Is Covid dangerous to us? _If so_…
-   Can we avoid catching it? _If not_…
-   Can we minimize the danger? _If so_…
-   What options are realistically available to us? _For each_…
-   Is this effective at minimizing the danger? _If so_…
-   At what cost? _and_…
-   What is unknowable and how should we account for that?

Getting to the starting line took me ~95,000 words of notes, highlights, and first-pass summaries.

To then write the three essays answering the first subquestion took me another 6 months: finding a narrative thread, double-checking my working, estimating my trust in the underlying data, and a long slog of summarising without misleading.

My goal was to protect and educate those I love. I had a [pretty good track-record](emailWarning).

I failed as hard as a man could fail. My efforts changed nothing but my hair colour.

Oh well. [What does Covid do?](symptoms)
