I wrote this for my Mum to help her make an _informed_ choice about how to live during Covid.

I showed my working, provided context, and let her reach her own conclusions. There wasn’t much of that available at the time.

Covid information was a cesspit of lies: noble lies, lies of incompetence, lies of arse-covering, and lies for fun and profit.

By late 2020 my Mum had adopted the certainty and models of one team of liars. Her actions began to reflect those wonky models.

_Adult_ decisions about how to live require an understanding of risk.

The lies made it unforgivably difficult to get one or, worse, correct one.

Nonetheless, I tried.

Specifically I tried to answer the question “_Should we get a Covid vaccine?_”, starting with:

-   Is Covid dangerous to us? _If so_…
-   Can we avoid catching it? _If not_…
-   Can we minimize the danger? _If so_…
-   What options are realistically available to us? _For each_…
-   Is this effective at minimizing the danger? _If so_…
-   At what cost? _and_…
-   What is unknowable and how should we account for that?

The good-faith answers I found were mostly oversimplifications of complex topics or heavy on assumptions. I set out to understand the complex and replace assumptions with arguments I could justify.

Getting to the starting line took me ~95,000 words of notes, highlights, and first-pass summaries.

To then write the three essays here took me another 6 months: finding a narrative thread, double-checking my working, estimating my trust in the underlying data, and a long slog of summarising without misleading.

My goal was to protect and educate those I love.

I failed as hard as a man could fail. My efforts changed nothing but my hair colour.

Oh well. [What does Covid do?](symptoms).
